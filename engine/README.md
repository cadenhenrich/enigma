## What it is
This is an abstractified version of the project one folder up from this one (online). The purpose of this is to try to cleanly abstractify the concepts I've learned in the previous OpenGL learning guides I've completed and make it easier to work with new ones in the future.

## Who is it for
Me. Look at it if you want.
